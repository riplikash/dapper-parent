* Dapper Engine           
* An OpenGL "game" engine using:   
* Java, Spring, and Maven

ABOUT
The Dapper Engine is just a small side project of mine for learning new 
technologies in a moderately stable and portable environment using one of
my favorite aspects of software as a focus: interactive computer graphics.

While many of the various free systems out there have more features, that
is really besides the point. I like learning to build things from scratch,
so that is what I'm doing here.

CURRENT FEATURES
Basic 2D drawing and control
Swing supported modular injection of control
Maven2 build system
Simple 2d font system

INSTALLATION
The Dapper Engine uses maven to provide fairly simple setup in any maven build 
enviroment. On my end I typicaly just impot it as a maven project in SpringSource
Tools Suite or Intellij. A simple Maven install is typically enough to get things 
up and running.

There currently are no stand alone applications. I'm still mainly focused on it as
a library. The unit tests in the DapperEngine module are my preferred way to run things.
